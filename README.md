Hello!
I'm Kevin, a Data Science Specialist Undergrad at the University of Toronto.

Data science is a multifaceted discipline, and I'm still trying to figure out my interests. Here are some skills:
- Programming: mainly Python and JavaScript, used in my projects
- Machine Learning: PyTorch, LangChain, scikit-learn
- Project Management: From internship experience
